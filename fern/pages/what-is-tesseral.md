## What Tesseral is

Tesseral helps software developers with auth. Tesseral helps developers answer questions like *who is this user* and (to a lesser extent) *what is this user allowed to do*. It maintains a list of users. It [authenticates](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/authentication) users. It includes everything you'd need to make a login box work.

In opaque industry language, Tesseral provides [customer identity and access management (CIAM)](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/customer-identity-access-management-ciam) software. 

## Who Tesseral is for
### For business software

Tesseral focuses on multi-tenant business software applications that run on cloud infrastructure (i.e., B2B SaaS). Tesseral *can* accommodate single-tenant use cases, and it *can* accommodate on-premise use cases.

Tesseral does not easily serve consumer applications like social media, ecommerce, or video games. Developers of such software should consider other cloud services or open source frameworks. 

### For most developers

Tesseral's design emphasizes ease of use and secure defaults. Implementation requires full-stack web development experience and working knowledge of software security principles. It does not require deep expertise in security. Most developers can use Tesseral.

Tesseral does not currently prioritize deep customization. Experienced developers with highly unusual or complex requirements may not find Tesseral suitable for their work.


## Commercial open source

Tesseral is open source software. It is [MIT-licensed](https://github.com/tesseral-labs/tesseral?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) and therefore available for use without restriction. The source code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/tesseral-labs/tesseral). 

Tesseral is also a commercial enterprise, one that earns revenue from selling a managed service of the open source software. In the future, the company may develop additional *proprietary* features for the software.
