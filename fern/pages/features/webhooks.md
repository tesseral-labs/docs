# What are webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for one application to send real-time data to another application. They are often
used to notify an application when an event occurs in another application. For example, when a new
Organization is created or when a new User joins an Organization, you might want to perform some
work on your side of the house to ensure you handle these events appropriately.

## Using webhooks with Tesseral

When you create your Tesseral Project, we automatically create a webhook configuration for you. This
is an empty configuration that you can add your own Endpoints to to receive events from Tesseral.

You can find the webhook settings in the Webhooks section of your Project settings page.

By clicking the "Edit" button, you can visit the webhook portal to manage your webhook endpoints.

### Managing webhook endpoints

You can add, edit, and delete webhook endpoints in the webhook portal. Each endpoint has a URL that
Tesseral will send events to.

To create a new endpoint, click the "Add endpoint" button. You will be prompted to enter an endpoint URL
and an optional description. The URL must be a valid URL that Tesseral can send events to.

Once you have created an endpoint, Tesseral will send events to that endpoint whenever a relevant event occurs in your Project.

## Webhook event format

Tesseral sends events to your webhook endpoints for the following events:

- **User Created**: A new User has been created in your Project.
- **User Updated**: A User has been updated in your Project.
- **User Deleted**: A User has been deleted in your Project.
- **Organization Created**: A new Organization has been created in your Project.
- **Organization Updated**: An Organization has been updated in your Project.
- **Organization Deleted**: An Organization has been deleted in your Project.

All events are bundled into two basical event types:

- **sync.user**: This event is sent when a User is created, updated, or deleted.
- **sync.organization**: This event is sent when an Organization is created, updated, or deleted.

The event body will contain a JSON object with the following format:

**sync.user**

```json
{
  "type": "sync.user",
  "userId": "user_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

**sync.organization**

```json
{
  "type": "sync.organization",
  "organizationId": "org_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## Processing webhook events

When Tesseral sends an event to your webhook endpoint, it will send a POST request to the URL you
provided. The request body will contain a JSON object with the following the format detailed in the
Webhook event format section.

The way to indicate that a webhook has been processed is by returning a 2xx (status code 200-299)
response to the webhook message within a reasonable time-frame (typically about 15s). It's also
important to disable CSRF protection for this endpoint if the framework you use enables them by
default.
