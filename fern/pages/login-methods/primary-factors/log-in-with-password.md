Adding Log in with Password to your Tesseral [Project](/docs/concepts/projects)
gives your customers the ability to use a password to log into your
product. Configuring Log in with Password doesn't require any code.

## Configure Log in with Password

To enable Log in with Password support to your product, go into the Tesseral
Console and go to your [Project
Settings](https://console.tesseral.com/project-settings). Go to the section
titled "Login Methods" and click "Edit".

Enable the "Log in with Password" option and click "Save".

## Customer Configuration

Your customer does not need to take any steps to use Log in with Password. All new
customer [Organizations](/docs/concepts/organizations) support Log in with
Password once you enable Log in with Password on your
[Project](/docs/concepts/projects).

It's common for customers to want to disable Log in with Password for their
organization. They can do this self-serve from their [Self-Serve Organization
Settings](/docs/features/self-serve-organization-settings), or you can do it on
their behalf by:

1. Going to your [Project's
   Organizations](https://console.tesseral.com/organizations) in the Tesseral
   Console.

2. Choosing your customer's organization from the list.

3. Under the Organization's "Details" section, click "Edit".

4. Under "Login settings", switch "Log in with Password" off.

Disabling Log in with Password on an Organization only disables Log in with Password
for that specific Organization; all of your other customers can continue to use
Log in with Password.
