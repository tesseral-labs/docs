Adding Log in with email magic links to your Tesseral [Project](/docs/concepts/projects)
gives your customers the ability to receive an email with a link to log into your
product. Configuring Log in with Email Magic Links doesn't require any code.

## Configure Log in with Email Magic Links

By default Log in with Email Magic Links is enabled for your Tesseral Project.

If it's not enabled, you can enable it by going into the Tesseral Console and go to your
[Project Settings](https://console.tesseral.com/project-settings). Go to the section
titled "Login Methods" and click "Edit".

Enable the "Log in with Email (Magic Links)" option and click "Save".

## Customer Configuration

Your customer does not need to take any steps to use Log in with Email Magic Links. All
new customer [Organizations](/docs/concepts/organizations) support Log in with
Email once you enable Log in with Google on your
[Project](/docs/concepts/projects).

It's common for customers to want to disable Log in with Email Magic Links for their
organization. They can do this self-serve from their [Self-Serve Organization
Settings](/docs/features/self-serve-organization-settings), or you can do it on
their behalf by:

1. Going to your [Project's
   Organizations](https://console.tesseral.com/organizations) in the Tesseral
   Console.

2. Choosing your customer's organization from the list.

3. Under the Organization's "Details" section, click "Edit".

4. Under "Login settings", switch "Log in with Email (Magic Links)" off.

Disabling Log in with Email Magic Links on an Organization only disables Log in with Email Magic Links
for that specific Organization; all of your other customers can continue to use
Log in with Email Magic Links.
